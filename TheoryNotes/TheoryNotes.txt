Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) : spectral index used to highlight surface water
B3 (Green, 560nm)
B8 (NIR, 842nm)
NDWI = (B3 - B8)/(B3+B8)
Supraglacial lakes or melt ponds (wet ice surfaces are detectable when NDWI > 0.1 to 0.3)
Optional B11(SWI ~1610nm) can help distinguish snow bc B11 for snow and water is very low, a bit higher for ice)

Difference in Snow, Water, and Ice (snow and water having a relatively lower SWIR band)
1. Snow = small grains + high surface scattering
porous structure, multiple scattering in visible range | but strong absorption in SWIR

2. Glacial Ice = larger grains, dense structure
resulting in higher SWIR reflectance than fresh snow

FLAG: Sneed and Hamilton (2007) for relative depth measurements
